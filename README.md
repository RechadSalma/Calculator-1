# calculator draft - js / webpack / pwa / bootstrap

#### calculator / testing out calculator project 1st

## status: incomplete

-   Main goal was to get some hands on practice using these technologies
-   decided not to finish because it was taking too long, & wanted to move onto other projects that I have plan
    -   Plus I was not so please about my codes as it looks messy despit me trying to keep organise
-   I completed only the +plus operation. The other math symbol operation yet to be done
-   The +plus operation seems to not work fine even though it did before, however I will leave it & move one
    -   it is even worst on production mode as things just do not work as expected
-   successful in implementing js / pwa / bootstrap
    -   not with ease though
-   Learnt quite a lot, there is a difference between knowing & doing
