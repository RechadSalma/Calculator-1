TODO:
========DONE==========
-create snyk connection
-create two routes //cannot do production routes because my prod is ssr. but maybe when deployed it will have option to a fallback as csr
-create calculator layout
	-use bootstrap grid system to create a the calculator
-PWA
	-iK having trouble getting the manifest.json to work
	-iK cannot seem to get workbox to work on production mode
	-iK created pwatesting repo to test webpack pwa on live server Netlify
	-iK ALL WORKS AS LONG AS YOU USE LIVE SERVER ONLINE
	-iK quick test for pwa calculator on live server (netlify), all is ok?
	-iK You should switch pwa off while in development otherwise you could get crazy reload problems a lot. Turn back on when your ready to deploy or test site
========LEFT OFF==========
-currently on calculatorClass.js file
	-currrently doing pseudo for the handleMulipleDotsAsError method
		-just done reg expr for detecting multiple dots, & now continue back to pseudo
			-plan to use .test() method
======== PROGESS ==========

-#calculator function logic
class
    constructor (resultScreenElement, formulaScreenElement)
        resultScreenDom
        resultValue
	formulaScreenDom
	formuleEquationString
	formulaEquationArray

    backspace
    equal (update value of result value)
    formulaScreen
    resetCalculator
    mathSymbols

	-iK? use .reduce() method to add equations



=======YOU SHOULD DO THIS IF YOU GOT THE TIME========
-sanitize the layout innerHTML route once finish with routing


====COMEBACK=====
-do lighthouse check

-see whether it is worth IE support


======TEMPORARY SIDENOTES=======

search only legit integar /float number / one dot only ussing .test() method for regular expression
(^\d*\.?[^\.]\d*$|^\.\d*$)
	- however ending dot at the end after integar will not work
	- bizarrely it takes exactly one letter character followed by any degits following. I cannot understand this & cold not get it to go away
